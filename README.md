- Stanley Wang
- Jagan Gedela
- Luis Alberto Robles Hernandez

## INTRODUCTION

In this project, we created a three way classifier in order to automatically identify different stances with respect to health mandates related to COVID-19, wheter they are in favor, against, or it is unclear. The source of the dataset can be found under the *dataset* folder.

This project was divided in the following categories:
- **Hydration of tweets**
- **Pre-processing of data**
- **Training/Fine-tuning**
- **Generation of reports**

Each of the previous categories are explained in their respective folder found in this repository.

## REQUIREMENTS

In order to run all scripts submitted in this repo, the following programs and tools and modules must be installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Google Colab (for the training process)

Moreover, the following Python modules are required:
- emot (version 2.1)
- emoji (1.2.0)
- transformers (4.1.8 is recommended)
- number_parser (any version)
- sklearn
- pandas
- numPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn (any version)
